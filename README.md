This project contains a Jupyter Notebook analysis on a fictional pharmaceutical study on the effectiveness of drugs treating squamouse cell carcinoma. The Capomulin regimen was the highlighted regimin of interest to the organization.

Conclusions are highlighted at the start of the notebook. The provided data was cleaned then the following statistical analysis included:
    
    Tumor Volume: Mean, Median, Variance, Standard Deviation, and Standard Error
    
Using both Pandas and Matplotlib, figures were created to illustrate:

    Number of Timepoints gathered for each drug regimen (bar plot)
    Distribution of male and female mice throughout the study (pie plot)
    
Additional figures portray:

    Inter-Quartile Range of final tumor volume among drug regimens of interest, determining outliers (box-and-whisker plot)
    Tumor volume change over time for a selected mouse within the Capomulin treatment regimen (line plot)
    Average tumor volume related to mouse weight within the Capomulin regimen (scatter plot)
        This final plot also includes correlation and linear regression analysis
